# Involute of the circle distance calculations

This repository contains a prototype Python implementation of the algorithm
to calculate the distances to an involute of a circle. This is useful in
surface-tracking based Monte Carlo calculations of the research nuclear
reactors, which use involute-shaped fuel plates.

Note that the algorithm is intended just as an example which can be used
to develop and test a practical version in C, Fortran or C++ etc.
It is not optimised Python in any shape or form.
